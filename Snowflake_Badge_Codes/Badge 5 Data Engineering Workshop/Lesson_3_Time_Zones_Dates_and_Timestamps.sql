ðŸŽ¯ CHALLENGE: Filter Out the Old Rows
Can you write a select statement that will filter out the old rows? Remember that one column was added and another was removed. Using one or both of these fields can you write a SELECT that will return only rows from the second file? 

Two possible solutions are listed on the next page. Take your time and try to solve this on your own before proceeding.

ðŸŽ¯ CHALLENGE: Update Your LOG View
Change the LOG view definition so that it no longer contains an AGENT column.

Add a WHERE clause that will remove the first set of records from the view results. Do NOT remove the rows from the table.
